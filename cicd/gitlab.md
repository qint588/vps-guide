Setting up **GitLab CI/CD** involves configuring GitLab to automatically build, test, and deploy your code when changes are pushed to the repository. Here's how you can set up GitLab CI/CD on your VPS:

---

## Step 1: Install GitLab Runner on Your VPS

GitLab Runner is the tool that runs your CI/CD jobs. You'll need to install it on your VPS.

1. **Update your package list**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y curl
   ```

3. **Add the GitLab Runner repository**:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-runner/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
   ```

4. **Install GitLab Runner**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install gitlab-runner
   ```

5. **Check the GitLab Runner version**:
   ```bash
   gitlab-runner --version
   ```

---

## Step 2: Register GitLab Runner

Once GitLab Runner is installed, you need to register it with your GitLab instance.

1. **Obtain the GitLab registration token**:
   - Go to your GitLab project.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **CI / CD**.
   - Expand the **Runners** section and copy the **registration token**.

2. **Register the runner**:
   Run the following command on your VPS to register the GitLab Runner:
   ```bash
   sudo gitlab-runner register
   ```

   You will be prompted to enter the following information:
   - **GitLab instance URL**: Enter the URL of your GitLab instance (e.g., `https://gitlab.com/` or your self-hosted GitLab instance).
   - **Registration token**: Paste the token you copied earlier.
   - **Description**: Provide a description for the runner (e.g., `My VPS Runner`).
   - **Tags**: Optionally, you can add tags (e.g., `docker`, `deploy`).
   - **Executor**: Choose an executor for the runner. Common options include `shell` (runs on the server directly), `docker`, and `docker-ssh`. For a simple setup, use `shell`.

3. After successful registration, GitLab Runner will be available for running jobs.

## Step 3: Create `.gitlab-ci.yml` File

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is where you define your CI/CD pipeline. This file should be placed at the root of your GitLab repository.

### Example `.gitlab-ci.yml` File

Here's a simple example of a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for a Node.js application:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

# Build Stage
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build

# Test Stage
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test

# Deploy Stage
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production server..."
    - scp -r ./dist user@yourserver:/path/to/deploy
  only:
    - master
```

This configuration defines three stages:
1. **Build**: Installs dependencies and builds the application.
2. **Test**: Runs tests.
3. **Deploy**: Deploys the application to a production server (only for changes in the `master` branch).

You can modify this file based on the technology stack you're using (PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.) and the deployment strategy.

---

## Step 4: Push `.gitlab-ci.yml` to Your GitLab Repository

1. **Commit and push the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file** to your GitLab repository:
   ```bash
   git add .gitlab-ci.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration"
   git push origin master
   ```

---

## Step 5: Verify CI/CD Pipeline

Once the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is pushed to your repository, GitLab will automatically trigger the pipeline. You can monitor the progress of the pipeline by:

1. Go to your **GitLab repository**.
2. Navigate to **CI / CD** > **Pipelines**.
3. You will see the pipeline with the stages and jobs defined in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
4. If everything is configured correctly, you will see the jobs running under their respective stages.

---

## Step 6: Optional - Set Up Deployment (for Production)

To deploy your application to a production server automatically after a successful pipeline, you need to configure SSH or another deployment method.

### Example Deployment with SSH

1. **Generate an SSH key** for the GitLab Runner to connect to your VPS:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "gitlab-runner" -f ~/.ssh/gitlab_runner_key
   ```

2. **Add the public key to your server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`** file for the user you want to deploy as.

3. **Add the private key to GitLab CI/CD settings**:
   - Go to **GitLab** > **Settings** > **CI / CD**.
   - Expand the **Variables** section.
   - Add a new variable:
     - **Key**: `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
     - **Value**: Paste the contents of your `~/.ssh/gitlab_runner_key` file.

4. **Modify your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file** to use the SSH key for deployment:
   ```yaml
   deploy:
     stage: deploy
     script:
       - mkdir -p ~/.ssh
       - echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
       - chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
       - scp -r ./dist user@yourserver:/path/to/deploy
     only:
       - master
   ```

---

## Step 7: Test the Pipeline

Push some code to your GitLab repository (or trigger a commit via merge request). The pipeline should automatically trigger, go through the defined stages (build, test, deploy), and deploy to your server if configured.

---

## Summary

You have successfully set up **GitLab CI/CD** on your VPS:
1. Installed **GitLab Runner** on your VPS.
2. Registered the runner with your **GitLab repository**.
3. Created a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to define your pipeline.
4. Configured your deployment (optional).
5. Verified that the pipeline runs on commits to your repository.
