To set up **GitHub CI/CD** using **GitHub Actions**, follow these steps:

---

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

If you don't have a GitHub repository yet, create one:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
2. Click on **New Repository**.
3. Choose a name, description, and visibility (public or private).
4. Click **Create Repository**.

---

## Step 2: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow File

GitHub Actions uses YAML files to define workflows that specify the steps to be performed in your CI/CD pipeline. These files are located in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository.

1. **Create the `.github/workflows` directory** in the root of your project (if it doesn't exist already).

2. **Create a new YAML file** for your workflow, for example, `ci.yml`.

---

### Example Workflow File for a Node.js Project

Here’s an example of a simple CI/CD workflow file for a **Node.js** application:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to server
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to production server..."
          # Replace this with your actual deployment commands, like:
          # scp -r ./dist user@yourserver:/path/to/deploy
        env:
          SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          SERVER: ${{ secrets.SERVER }}
```

---

## Step 3: Explanation of Workflow

1. **Trigger events (`on`)**: The pipeline is triggered on:
   - `push` events to the `main` branch.
   - `pull_request` events targeting the `main` branch.

2. **Job (`jobs`)**:
   - **runs-on**: Specifies that the job will run on the latest Ubuntu runner.
   - **steps**:
     - `actions/checkout@v2`: Checks out your code.
     - `actions/setup-node@v2`: Sets up Node.js on the runner.
     - `npm install`: Installs your dependencies.
     - `npm test`: Runs tests.
     - `npm run build`: Builds the application.
     - `Deploy to server`: Example deployment step (you can replace this with your actual deployment command, like using `scp` or deploying with Docker).

3. **Secrets**: Secrets such as SSH private keys or server credentials should be stored securely in GitHub Actions secrets (explained below).

---

## Step 4: Push the Workflow File

1. **Commit and push** your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
   git commit -m "Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions"
   git push origin main
   ```

---

## Step 5: Configure Secrets for Deployment (Optional)

If you’re using deployment (e.g., SSH keys for server access), you should store sensitive information in GitHub Secrets.

1. Go to your **GitHub repository**.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret** to add secrets such as:
   - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your SSH private key for deployment.
   - `SERVER`: The server hostname or IP address.

---

## Step 6: View Workflow Execution

Once you push the workflow file to GitHub:

1. Go to your **GitHub repository**.
2. Navigate to **Actions** from the top menu.
3. You will see the workflow runs listed with statuses such as `queued`, `in progress`, and `completed`.
4. Click on a run to see detailed logs for each step of the pipeline.

---

## Step 7: Verify and Test

Push changes to the `main` branch or create a pull request to trigger the workflow and verify that the CI/CD pipeline runs successfully.

1. **Push changes to the repository**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor the workflow** in the **Actions** tab to ensure that it passes.

---

## Step 8: Customizing the Workflow

You can customize the workflow file further based on your project needs. Here are some options you can include in your `.yml` file:

### Add Caching for Dependencies

Caching dependencies can speed up subsequent builds:

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

### Add Notifications (Optional)

You can set up notifications for workflow status. For example, you can send notifications to Slack or email when a build fails or passes.

---

## Summary

You have successfully:
1. Set up **GitHub Actions CI/CD** on your GitHub repository.
2. Created a workflow file to automate build, test, and deployment tasks.
3. Configured GitHub Secrets for secure deployment credentials.
4. Verified that your pipeline runs and deploys successfully.
